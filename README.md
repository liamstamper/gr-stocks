# Google Finance Clone - [gr-stocks.vercel.app](https://gr-stocks.vercel.app/)
### This is an in-progress project to build a fully functional clone of google finance using react and tailwind. Integrated with yahoos finance API it will fetch and display up to date stock market information.

Done:
* header (minus the apps modal and islogedin logic, also icon modal needs improvement) 
* frontend of Signin page
* frontend of the "market section" (the top area to see popular stocks/indexes and compare markets)

To Do:
* integrate yahoo stock api (I think this a good option to use, this may change)
* fix sidebar close function
* sidebar frontend
* find api for financial news
* handle login (maybe use real google accounts maybe make auth)
* "You may be intrerested in" section frontend
* handle personal portfolio storage
* market trends frontend
* filter for market trends
* seachbar frontend
* searchbar logic
etc
