# Google Finance Clone - [gr-stocks.vercel.app](https://gr-stocks.vercel.app/)

### This is an in-progress project to build a fully functional clone of google finance using react and tailwind. Integrated with yahoos finance API it will fetch and display up to date stock market information.

Done:

- header (minus the apps modal and islogedin logic, also icon modal needs improvement)
- frontend of Signin page
- frontend of the "market section" (the top area to see popular stocks/indexes and compare markets)
